## To-Do List
- [ ] Create `Ship` class with movement logic
- [ ] Implement menu selection
- [ ] Add basic river background
- [ ] Track collisions and score




- could move loading of settings to helper class or service? so game1.cs can just be for game logic
- need to make log file to write to instead of just the terminal lmao
- need to improve boundary managing stuff because it doesn't change as it gets resized 

I took this out of appsettings.json
    "Window": {
        "Width": 1400,
        "Height": 900,
        "Title": "Bow Thruster Challenge"
    },

## To-Do List
- [ ] Create `Ship` class with movement logic.
- [ ] Implement menu selection.
- [ ] Add basic river background.
- [ ] Track collisions and score.




- could move loading of settings to helper class or service? so game1.cs can just be for game logic
- need to make log file to write to instead of just the terminal lmao

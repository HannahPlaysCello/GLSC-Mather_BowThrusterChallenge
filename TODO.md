## this is nonsense please don't look at this i dont know what im doing


## To-Do List
- [ ] Create `Ship` class with movement logic
- [ ] Implement menu selection
- [ ] Add basic river background
- [ ] Track collisions and score


### stuff
- [ ] i put "instructionfont" sprite in to make a smalle rinstrucitons in the game play screen, but i only call fonts once for all text so i gotta figure that out




- could move loading of settings to helper class or service? so game1.cs can just be for game logic
- need to make log file to write to instead of just the terminal lmao
- need to improve boundary managing stuff because it doesn't change as it gets resized
